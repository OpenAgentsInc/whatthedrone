Q: Can you comment on the drones that are flying around New Jersey and the ports? It seems like the American people have a big disconnect.

Trump: The government knows what is happening. Look, our military knows where they took off from. If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage. They know where it came from and where it went. And for some reason, they don't want to comment. And I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows and our president knows. And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.

I can't imagine it's the enemy because if it was the enemy that blast it out even if they were late they'd blast it. Something strange is going on. For some reason, they don't want to tell the people.

And they should, because the people are really, I mean, they happen to be over Bedminster, want to know the truth. They're very close to Bedminster. I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster. I've decided to cancel my trip.
