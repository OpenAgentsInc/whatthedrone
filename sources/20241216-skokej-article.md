So a funny thing has been happening with the drone story.

None of the official stories make sense.

Local elected officials and law enforcement are saying it’s a real, serious problem. Police say the drones don’t emit heat signatures and easily evade their own industrial grade interceptor drones.

Multiple sensitive military sights have gotten overflights. Picatinny Arsenal has confirmed at least 11 sightings. Naval Weapons Station Earle had to activate their de-droning equipment. Wright-Patterson is the latest to report overflights (which has its own special significance in UAP lore). Last night, Wright-Patterson actually had to close their airspace (radio traffic audio link here) because of the amount of “UAS activity” (UAS = “unmanned aerial system”) over the base. The FBI says they’re investigating and they’re stumped.

Police in New Jersey say the drones give off no heat signature and go stealth when they try to get near them. One officer said he saw 50 of the drones coming off the water:


The Pentagon has said that they don’t know who is responsible and are frustrated by the activity, but also claimed that the drones are not US Military and are not believed to be from any foreign entity or adversary. But they’ve also said they see no reason to believe they’re a public threat.

Which makes no sense - how can you know they’re not a threat if you don’t know whose they are and what they’re doing?

Meanwhile, the White House offers a gigantic shrug and a condescending dismissal of the whole affair:


Meanwhile, what appears to be a disinformation campaign continues apace.

It started with Congressman Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey giving Fox News '“the real deal” on December 11, telling them that “very high sources” said that Iran launched a “mothership” that is launching drones off the East Coast of America.

The second that narrative hit the airwaves, it spread like wildfire. Every other person responding to posts about this that day was bringing it up like it was Gospel.

The same day, the Pentagon slammed that theory in no uncertain terms:


But then a new narrative arose on December 14. An X account under the username “Jersey Futures” that was deleted was cited by a modestly sized account called “Redhat” (just 6,300 followers) that got 16 million views and went viral. The screenshots from the no longer-active “Jersey Futures” account claimed that the drones were “american made HPGe nuclear detector drones” that were part of a stockpile the US had been saving up “for a while.”

“They look weird because they’re heavy and have giant Cryocoolers mounted and giant horn antennas to communicate on mmwave frequencies that can’t be jammed,” it said. The person claimed that the tech used in these drones utilized “high purity germanium” which are “the backbone of my industry.”

“So what are they doing?” Jersey Futures asked. “Collecting information in how public will react (PsyOp) and testing their ability to sweep a port city like NY for dirty bombs.”

That story got traction. People started speculating that the drones were US government tech that was sweeping the area for nuclear or biological materials — some speculated that they could be missing warheads from Ukraine — which gave up its old Soviet warheads decades ago.

But it sounded good, and it kept spreading.

And then came this guy: John Ferguson, CEO of Saxon Aerospace in Wichita Kansas. Saxon makes “military grade unmanned aircraft.” And he put forward his own version of that same theory (summary below if you don’t care to watch):


Richard Geldreich, a software developer and UFO researcher who has been doing a phenomenal job covering this drone story on X, posted an AI summary of the video, heading it up with the words: “containment narrative.” I’ll return to that phrase in a moment.


Saxon got retweeted by Joe Rogan, who said, “This is the first video about these drones that has got me genuinely concerned.” The original video post on X now sits at 12.8 million views.

I have been sent this video approximately the exact same number of times, so I want to address it. I recorded my own middle aged white guy video last night. (And yeah, I left the shower running for 5 minutes because I have ADHD and decided to film this before I got in because I knew I wouldn’t do it after, so don’t give me a hard time!)


That random video that I decided to make at 11 at night before jumping in the shower now has over 1.6 million views. People are so hungry for answers.

Others have begun to echo my thoughts that this “nuclear search narrative” is a ruse.

Ryan Graves, a former Navy F/A-18 pilot who has been advocating for transparency about the frequency of UAP experiences by military pilots (and the flight safety risk they pose) said this yesterday:


Ross Coulthart, the investigative journalist who wrote In Plain Sight: A fascinating investigation into UFOs and alien encounters from an award-winning journalist, held the first public interview with Pentagon UFO whistleblower David Grusch, and now hosts Reality Check on NewsNation, said the same:


Jesse Michels of American Alchemy actually went there and laid it all out today:

You know we’re in weird territory when a nuclear threat IS the Psy Op. This loose nuke narrative is fake. It’s a clean story. But whatever is actually happening is probably weirder and less simple.

Many of the fixed wing drones with red and green lights are (likely?) manmade. Orbs and other UAVs around sensitive nuclear sites and Air Force bases across the United States? That sounds remarkably like the 167 historical cases of on record witnesses (stand up employees of nuclear bases who are BEYOND reproach) documented by Robert Hastings in his great book UFOs and Nukes. These flying objects often shut down our most advanced weaponry (Vandenberg 64’, Malmstrom 67’, Fe Warren 2010 etc). If any true UFOs are here, it would make complete sense that you’d get a mix of human drones alongside them. What’s the prosaic explanation for these non-fixed wing orbs and more exotic looking, impossible to fend off, high electromagnetism “drones” flying with impunity around our sensitive military installations? High powered lasers? Plasma balls? Classified American tech that we’re using to red team or troll our most intensely locked down military sites (and that’s somehow also happening all around the world)?

I have no idea what these are and why they’re here but maybe we should start thinking about those questions given where humanity is right now. No one should worship them “project Bluebeam” style, (something no one is pushing besides the likes of Billy Carson). We should just use the presence of these things to do a hard audit of ourselves and our world which is very on the brink.

This whole saga may stay inconclusive for a while. But when “contact” does happen, it will be hard for even the most die hard of “UFO advocates” to believe. Material manifestations are much harder to stomach than abstract intellectual entertainment. 2025 may be the weirdest, most “ontologically shocking” year we have had in the last millennium. But if the weirdness helps prevent cataclysm and takes the governor of physics, heterodox ideas and nihilistic disenchantment, I’m here for it.

So let me return to the idea of the “containment narrative.”

Google will give you some unrelated nonsense if you look that up. So let me give you the contextual scoop. Quite literally, this means: “a narrative to contain the real story the powers that be don’t want you to hear.”

And that is exactly what this nuclear weapon search narrative is. A containment narrative.

As I’ve already said, first it was the "Iranian mothership" disinformation. That immediately spread like wildfire and everyone was so certain it was the correct answer. Now we've shifted to "the government is searching for adversarial biological or nuclear weapons, but only at nighttime, and only using completely unrecognizable tech that can't be interdicted and produces no heat signature but is lit up like a Christmas tree for stealth purposes and oh by the way they come from the ocean and nobody has seen them take off or land and the DoD is lying to us about it without even a cover story and are refusing to cooperate with local law enforcement, elected officials, or the FBI, who are all trying to investigate this because nobody will tell them what's going on."

And somehow, THAT is more plausible to people.

Meanwhile, every other comment on any drone-related information is the buried-ostrich-head snarky talking point du jour: "It's just an effing plane, bro."

Not to mention that these things are showing up in in several east coast states (NJ, NY, CT, PA, MA) and have also been reported in CA, NC, TX, TN, VA, GA, MO, LA, OR...and also in the UK, China, Russia, and Australia.

But it's a “nuclear material search” in NJ.


This morning, President-elect Trump also weighed in. He says the government knows what’s going on, and for some reason, is refusing to tell us:
