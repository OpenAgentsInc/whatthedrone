SPEAKER_00 (00:05 - 00:08):  You hear all of these officials, you've heard a lot of concern, a lot of coverage. Where are you tonight on this?
SPEAKER_01 (00:08 - 00:29):  As we look at the information we've got, Brett, and we've now examined some 5,000 different sightings. We've added detection capabilities, additional observers. As you and I stand here today, two date, our assessment is that this is lawful, legal, commercial, hobbyist, and even law enforcement, aircraft activity.
SPEAKER_01 (00:29 - 00:44):  Some of it's manned, some of it's unmanned. We absolutely acknowledge that a lot of these are probably drones, but they're flying legally. And it is legal to fly drones in non-restricted airspace as long as you're registered with the FAA.
SPEAKER_01 (00:44 - 00:55):  And there's thousands and thousands of these kinds of flights every single day. I think there's more than a million drones that are registered with the FAA just in the United States alone.
