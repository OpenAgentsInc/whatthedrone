# Test-Time Compute for Graph Insights

## Overview

Test-time compute (TTC) scaling allows language models to "think longer" about complex problems by allocating additional compute at inference time. For WhatTheDrone's knowledge graph, we can leverage TTC to have Llama models analyze connections between nodes and derive higher-level insights about drone-related events and patterns.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Graph Traversal with TTC

Instead of making single-pass inferences about node relationships, we can use TTC approaches to:

- Generate multiple candidate interpretations of node connections
- Use a process reward model (PRM) to score the quality of each interpretation
- Iteratively refine the interpretations through beam search
- Combine high-quality insights using weighted aggregation

### 2. Search Strategies

We'll implement three key search strategies from the DeepMind paper:

1. **Best-of-N Sampling**
   - Generate N independent interpretations of node connections
   - Use PRM to score each interpretation
   - Weight and combine the highest quality insights

2. **Beam Search with PRM**
   - Start with initial node connections
   - Generate multiple candidate next steps
   - Use PRM to score and select most promising paths
   - Continue expanding until reaching conclusion

3. **Diverse Verifier Tree Search (DVTS)**
   - Split initial beams into independent subtrees
   - Expand each subtree greedily using PRM
   - Maintain diversity in interpretation paths
   - Combine insights from different perspectives

### 3. Integration with Graph Structure

```typescript
interface GraphAnalysis {
  nodes: Node[];
  edges: Edge[];
  insights: {
    patterns: Pattern[];
    anomalies: Anomaly[];
    predictions: Prediction[];
  };
  confidence: number;
}

async function analyzeGraphWithTTC(
  graph: Graph,
  llm: LlamaModel,
  prm: ProcessRewardModel,
  config: TTCConfig
): Promise<GraphAnalysis> {
  // Implementation using search strategies above
}
```

## Example Use Cases

1. **Pattern Detection**
   - Identify recurring patterns in drone sightings
   - Discover temporal/geographic correlations
   - Map relationships between different entities

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Find unusual connections or outliers
   - Identify potential misinformation
   - Highlight data inconsistencies

3. **Predictive Analysis**
   - Project future drone activity patterns
   - Assess likelihood of different scenarios
   - Generate hypotheses about motivations

## Performance Optimization

1. **Compute Budget Allocation**
   - Allocate more compute to complex subgraphs
   - Use difficulty estimation for budget scaling
   - Cache common analysis patterns

2. **Local-First Processing**
   - Run lightweight models on device
   - Batch complex analyses for server processing
   - Implement progressive enhancement

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache embeddings and intermediate results
   - Store common inference patterns
   - Implement LRU cache for analysis results

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Basic TTC Integration**
   - Implement Best-of-N sampling
   - Add basic PRM scoring
   - Create simple insight generation

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Search**
   - Add beam search capability
   - Implement DVTS
   - Enhance PRM accuracy

3. **Phase 3: Optimization**
   - Add compute-optimal scaling
   - Implement caching
   - Optimize for mobile performance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Model Ensemble**
   - Combine insights from different models
   - Weight based on model confidence
   - Cross-validate findings

2. **Interactive Analysis**
   - Allow user guidance in search process
   - Provide explanation of reasoning steps
   - Enable feedback incorporation

3. **Continuous Learning**
   - Update analysis patterns from user feedback
   - Adapt to new types of connections
   - Improve accuracy over time

## Integration with Existing System

The TTC analysis will integrate with our current system:

```typescript
// In GraphView.tsx
interface TTCAnalysisProps {
  selectedNodes: Node[];
  analysisDepth: number;
  computeBudget: number;
}

function TTCAnalysisPanel({ 
  selectedNodes,
  analysisDepth,
  computeBudget
}: TTCAnalysisProps) {
  // Implementation
}
```

This enhancement will allow WhatTheDrone to provide deeper insights into drone-related patterns and connections, while maintaining efficient local-first operation through optimized test-time compute scaling.
